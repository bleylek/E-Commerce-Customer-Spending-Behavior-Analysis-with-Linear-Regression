E-Commerce Customer Spending Behavior Analysis

Overview:
This repository contains an analytical project focused on understanding customer spending behavior for an E-commerce clothing company. By employing Linear Regression and various data analysis techniques, we delve into the relationships between different customer interaction metrics and the total yearly amount spent on the platform. This project aims to provide actionable insights that could help in strategizing the focus on either the mobile app experience or website enhancements to drive sales growth.

Project Structure:
- Imports: Setting up the necessary Python libraries for data manipulation and visualization.
- Data Retrieval: Loading and examining the customer dataset to understand its structure and contents.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting an initial analysis to explore the data, understand the distributions of key variables, and identify relationships between them.
- Linear Regression Model: Developing a model to predict customer spending based on their interactions with the mobile app and website, and evaluating the model's performance.

Key Findings:
Through exploratory data analysis and linear regression modeling, we identify key predictors of yearly spending and assess the impact of various customer interaction metrics, such as time spent on the app and website, on purchasing decisions. The insights derived from this analysis aim to inform the E-commerce company's decision-making regarding optimizing their mobile app or website to enhance customer experience and drive sales.

Technologies Used:
- Python: For data processing and analysis.
- Pandas and NumPy: For data manipulation.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
- Scikit-learn: For implementing Linear Regression and model evaluation.

Disclaimer:
The data used in this project is synthetic and designed for illustrative purposes of data analysis techniques.
